/**
 * Missile micro: think Stalker micro from SC2. Good for dealing with those
 * pesky melee/teleporting/zapper units.
 *
 * Suggested loadout:
 * - missiles 3
 * - thrusters 3
 * - 1 in other equipment
 *
 * Situationally, this means...
 * - shield 1: is generally good all around
 * - zapper 1: good if cornered by melee units
 * - reflect 1: if fighting other missiles (this will generally dodge lasers)
 * - regen 1: if fighting slow (no thrusters) melee units
 * - mine 1
 *
 * Missiles 3, thrusters 2, shield 2 is possible to use against enemies with
 * high reflect and no thrusters (it saves 1 reflection).
